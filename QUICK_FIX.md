## üõ†Ô∏è Based on Your Issue:

### If you see "Cannot connect" or "Site can't be reached":

**The terminal that's running npm run dev might have stopped!**

Look at the terminal. Do you still see:
```
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:8080/
```

If NO, the server stopped. Restart it:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\nikes\OneDrive\Desktop\ielts-fluent-ai-main\ielts-fluent-ai-main"
npm run dev
```

### If you see a blank white page:

**Check browser console for errors:**
1. Press `F12` in browser
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for red errors
4. Tell me what errors you see

### If browser doesn't open at all:

**Try different browser:**
```powershell
# Chrome
Start-Process chrome "http://localhost:8080"

# Edge
Start-Process msedge "http://localhost:8080"

# Firefox
Start-Process firefox "http://localhost:8080"
```

## üí° MOST COMMON ISSUE:

### You're using VS Code's built-in browser!

**DON'T use VS Code preview!**

Instead:
1. Open **regular Chrome** or **Edge** (outside VS Code)
2. Type the URL manually
3. Should work perfectly

---

## üé¨ VIDEO WALKTHROUGH STEPS:

1. **Look at your screen right now**
   - Find the PowerShell terminal
   - Do you see "VITE ready" message? ‚úÖ Good!

2. **Open Chrome/Edge** (the actual program, not VS Code)
   - Click Start menu
   - Type "Chrome" or "Edge"
   - Open it

3. **In Chrome/Edge address bar**, type:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

4. **Press Enter**

5. **You SHOULD see:**
   - IELTS Fluent AI landing page
   - Orange/cream colors
   - "Start Free Practice" button
