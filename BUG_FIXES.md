# Bug Fixes - Speaking AI

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Question Repetition Bug
**Problem:** AI was repeating the same questions over and over instead of progressing through different questions.

**Root Cause:** 
- Used `Math.floor(messages.length / 2)` for question indexing, which caused the same index to be calculated repeatedly
- No tracking of which questions had already been asked

**Solution:**
- Added `askedQuestions` state (Set) to track all questions that have been asked
- Added `questionCount` state to properly track progress through exam parts
- Filter out already-asked questions before selecting next question
- Proper progression: 4-5 Part 1 questions ‚Üí Part 2 ‚Üí 4-5 Part 3 questions ‚Üí End

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added new state variables
const [askedQuestions, setAskedQuestions] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [questionCount, setQuestionCount] = useState(0);

// Updated question selection logic
const availableQuestions = topicQuestions.filter(q => !askedQuestions.has(q));
if (availableQuestions.length > 0) {
  nextQuestion = availableQuestions[0];
  setAskedQuestions(prev => new Set(prev).add(nextQuestion));
  setQuestionCount(prev => prev + 1);
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Answer Not Captured Bug
**Problem:** The AI wasn't capturing the speaker's answers - transcript was empty when processing responses.

**Root Cause:**
- Speech recognition may not have completed before `processStudentResponse` was called
- No validation that transcript exists before processing
- No visual feedback to user that their answer is being captured

**Solution:**
- Added `isCapturingAnswer` state to track when actively listening
- Added validation in `processStudentResponse` to check if transcript exists
- Added console logging for debugging transcript capture
- Clear transcript before starting new recording
- Show visual feedback with live transcript preview while capturing

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added validation
if (!transcript || transcript.trim().length === 0) {
  console.error('No transcript captured');
  setIsProcessing(false);
  alert('Sorry, I didn\'t catch your answer. Please try again and speak clearly.');
  return;
}

// Clear transcript before recording
setTranscript('');
setIsCapturingAnswer(true);

// Visual feedback component
{isCapturingAnswer && transcript && (
  <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
      <div className="animate-pulse rounded-full h-3 w-3 bg-green-500"></div>
      <span className="text-green-700 font-semibold">Capturing your answer...</span>
    </div>
    <p className="text-gray-700 italic">{transcript}</p>
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ No Feedback Generation Bug
**Problem:** The exam wasn't providing feedback at the end of the practice session.

**Root Cause:**
- `endExam()` function existed but wasn't being called when exam completed
- No proper trigger after Part 3 questions were completed

**Solution:**
- Added proper exam completion logic after Part 3 questions (after 10 total questions)
- Call `endExam()` when question limit is reached
- Call `endExam()` when all available questions have been asked
- Added error handling and logging in `endExam()` function

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// In Part 3 logic
if (questionCount < 10) {
  // Ask more questions
  // ...
} else {
  // End of exam after enough Part 3 questions
  await endExam();
  return;
}

// Also end if no more questions available
if (availableQuestions.length === 0) {
  await endExam();
  return;
}
```

## üîß Additional Improvements

### Better Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around speech recognition start/stop
- Console logging for debugging transcript capture
- User-friendly alert messages when microphone issues occur

### Enhanced User Experience
- Live transcript preview while speaking
- Visual indicator (green pulsing dot) when answer is being captured
- Better progression through exam parts (4-5 questions each)
- Proper question count tracking instead of message length

### Code Quality
- Removed reliance on message array length for logic
- Proper state management for exam flow
- Better separation of concerns

## üß™ Testing Checklist

To verify all bugs are fixed:

1. **Question Repetition:**
   - [ ] Start a practice session
   - [ ] Answer 4-5 Part 1 questions
   - [ ] Verify NO questions repeat
   - [ ] Verify smooth transition to Part 2

2. **Answer Capture:**
   - [ ] Click "Start Speaking"
   - [ ] Speak clearly into microphone
   - [ ] See green "Capturing your answer..." indicator
   - [ ] See live transcript appearing
   - [ ] Click "Stop Speaking"
   - [ ] Verify your answer appears in chat

3. **Feedback Generation:**
   - [ ] Complete full practice (Part 1 ‚Üí Part 2 ‚Üí Part 3)
   - [ ] Answer approximately 10 questions total
   - [ ] Verify feedback screen appears automatically
   - [ ] Verify feedback contains proper analysis

## üöÄ Next Steps

After testing these fixes:
1. Test with different topics
2. Test with imported question banks
3. Test microphone permissions on different browsers
4. Deploy to Vercel for production testing

## üìù Notes

- Speech recognition works best with clear speech and minimal background noise
- Chrome/Edge browsers have best speech recognition support
- Firefox and Safari may have limited support
- Always allow microphone permissions when prompted
