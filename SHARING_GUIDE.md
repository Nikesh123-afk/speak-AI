## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security Considerations:

**For Network Sharing:**
- Only share with people you trust
- They'll use YOUR Perplexity API key
- Consider API rate limits

**For Public Deployment:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Your Perplexity API key is in the code!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone can use it and consume your API credits
- ‚úÖ Solution: Setup backend API with authentication
- ‚úÖ Solution: Add rate limiting

### Recommended Security Setup:

Before public deployment, you should:
1. Move API key to backend server
2. Add user authentication (already have this!)
3. Add API rate limiting
4. Use environment variables properly
5. Setup usage monitoring
