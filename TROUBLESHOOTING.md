# 🔧 Server Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Server is RUNNING!

**Status:** 🟢 Active  
**Port:** 8080  
**Started:** Successfully

### 🌐 Your Links:

**Copy and paste this in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:8080
```

**For mobile/other devices (same WiFi):**
```
http://192.168.100.14:8080
```

---

## ❓ Still Not Working? Try These Steps:

### Step 1: Check Terminal
Look at your terminal. You should see:
```
VITE v5.4.10  ready in 1059 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:8080/
➜  Network: http://192.168.100.14:8080/
```

✅ If you see this, server IS running!

### Step 2: Open Browser Correctly

**DO THIS:**
1. Open a **NEW browser window** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Click on the **address bar** at the top
3. Type or paste: `http://localhost:8080`
4. Press **Enter**

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- ❌ Don't search it in Google
- ❌ Don't use VS Code's built-in preview
- ❌ Don't forget the `http://` part

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache

If page is blank or not loading:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Try the link again

OR

Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)

### Step 4: Check Your Firewall

Windows Firewall might be blocking:
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app through firewall"
3. Find Node.js and check both Private and Public
4. Click OK

### Step 5: Try Different Browser

If Chrome doesn't work:
- Try Microsoft Edge
- Try Firefox
- Try incognito/private mode

### Step 6: Check Port Availability

Run in terminal:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
```

If nothing shows up, port is free (good!).  
If something shows up, another app is using port 8080.

### Step 7: Restart Everything

1. In terminal, press `Ctrl + C` to stop server
2. Wait 2 seconds
3. Run again:
```powershell
npm run dev
```
4. Wait for "ready" message
5. Try the link again

## 🎯 Quick Test

**Run this to test if server responds:**

```powershell
Start-Process "http://localhost:8080"
```

This should open your default browser automatically.

## 🔍 What's Actually Happening?

The server **IS RUNNING** at port 8080. The terminal shows:
- ✅ VITE ready
- ✅ No error messages
- ✅ URLs displayed

**This means the server is working!**

### Possible Issues:

1. **Browser cache** - Old page cached
2. **Wrong URL** - Typing error
3. **Firewall** - Blocking localhost
4. **Antivirus** - Blocking Node.js
5. **VS Code browser** - Using wrong browser

---

## 💡 SIMPLE SOLUTION:

### Copy this EXACT command in PowerShell:

```powershell
Start-Process "http://localhost:8080"
```

Press Enter. Your browser should open automatically!

---

## 📱 Testing on Phone

1. **Connect phone to SAME WiFi** as computer
2. **Open phone browser** (Chrome/Safari)
3. **Type this URL:**
   ```
   http://192.168.100.14:8080
   ```
4. **Press Go/Enter**

If doesn't work:
- Check WiFi network (must be same)
- Check Windows Firewall (allow Node.js)
- Try IP: Run `ipconfig` and use IPv4 address

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ WRONG:
- `localhost:8080` (missing http://)
- `https://localhost:8080` (should be http, not https)
- Searching in Google
- Using different port number

### ✅ CORRECT:
- `http://localhost:8080`
- Typed in address bar
- Regular browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

## 🆘 Emergency: Complete Reset

If nothing works:

```powershell
# 1. Stop server
# Press Ctrl + C in terminal

# 2. Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 3. Reinstall dependencies
Remove-Item -Path "node_modules" -Recurse -Force
npm install

# 4. Restart server
npm run dev

# 5. Open browser
Start-Process "http://localhost:8080"
```

## 📞 Still Stuck?

Check these in order:
1. ✅ Terminal shows "VITE ready"?
2. ✅ Used http://localhost:8080 (with http://)?
3. ✅ Tried different browser?
4. ✅ Tried hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)?
5. ✅ Firewall allows Node.js?

If all ✅, then it MUST be working!
