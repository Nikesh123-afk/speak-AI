   - Choose from 10 built-in topics

## Common Use Cases

### 3. **Mock Tests**
Import actual IELTS past questions or mock test questions.

### 4. **Specific Preparation**
Focus on questions related to your background (e.g., IT students might create technology-focused questions).

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not parse the question bank"
- Check that your JSON is valid (use https://jsonlint.com)
- Ensure PART 1, PART 2, PART 3 headers are present in text files
- Make sure questions are on separate lines

### Questions not showing up
- Verify you have at least 3-5 questions in each part
- Check that questions are properly formatted (JSON array or bulleted list)

### Imported bank disappeared
- Question banks are stored in browser memory only
- They reset when you refresh the page
- Save your question bank files and re-import when needed

## Advanced: Creating Multiple Banks

You can create multiple question bank files for different topics:

- `work-questions.json`
- `travel-questions.json`
- `education-questions.json`
- `technology-questions.json`

Switch between them by importing different files each session!
